# Python Review: Functions Classwork

### Problem 1:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help (with variations :-P )
* Create a function that has a loop
* Prompt for numbers until the user enters ```q``` to quit
* If the user doesn't enter ```q```, ask them to input another number
* When the user enters ```q``` to quit, print the SUM of all numbers entered

BONUS: 
* Write your code so that it it doesn't matter if the User enters a lowercase or an uppercase ```q``` to quit
* Add extra validation to check that if the User doesn't enter ```q``` what they did enter is actually a number
